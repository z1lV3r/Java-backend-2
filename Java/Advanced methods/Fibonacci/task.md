# Fibonacci
The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is defined as the sum of the two numbers proceeding
it: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 â€¦

### Definitions
- For n = 0, the program should return 0.
- For n = 1, the program should return 1.
- For other positive values of n, the program should compute the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence using a loop or recursive method.

````java
fibonacci(0) //return 0
fibonacci(1) //return 1
fibonacci(2) //return 1
fibonacci(5) //return 5
fibonacci(10) //return 55
