# Fridges

In this exercise, you will enhance the functionality of the Fridge company system which is about to integrate a new branch (Fridge3) on stock.
Additionally, the customer is looking to add the function to provide the Kelvin temperature for each of the Fridges supported by our system.

You were warned to be prepared because in the following days the system will include 7 new branches.

### Requirements:
- Refactor the code to support the new operation for all the Fridges

    ````java
    public float getKelvinTemperature()
    ````
    <div class="hint">
        Kelvin temperature = Celsius + 273.15
    </div>

- Make a mechanism to add easily more Fridge branches

- Fix a bug on Branch1 getFahrenheitTemperature there is some error during calculations
